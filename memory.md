## Last session (2026-07-31)

**Security audit & hardening** — Full 5-prompt security review (Gitleaks, Bearer, ECC Production
Audit, Trail of Bits, ECC Security Review) applied to the codebase. 9 fixes pushed.

### What was done
1. `src/utils/supabase/client.js` — Removed hardcoded Supabase URL/key fallbacks (were leaking
   project ID into source code even without env vars set).
2. `src/lib/auth.js` — `requireClient()` was fetching ALL clients then filtering in JS;
   now uses `.eq("owner_email", email).maybeSingle()` for DB-level filtering.
3. `src/app/api/settings/route.js` — GET returned `{}` (200) for unauthenticated requests;
   now returns 401. All error responses hide `e.message`; DB queries use `.eq()` filter.
   PATCH similarly fixed.
4. `src/app/api/generate-prompt/route.js` — Final catch was returning `e.message` to client;
   now logs server-side and returns generic "Internal server error".
5. `src/app/api/ig/callback/route.js` — `IG_APP_ID` had hardcoded fallback `"1249182887184854"`;
   removed. Now fails with 500 if env var missing.
6. `src/app/api/auth/route.js` — No rate limiting on admin password check;
   added IP-based rate limit: 5 attempts/minute using existing `rate-limit.js`.
7. `next.config.js` — Added security headers to all routes:
   X-Frame-Options: DENY, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff,
   Strict-Transport-Security (1 year), Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy.
8. `src/app/api/messenger/route.js` — Added `verifyFBSignature()` using HMAC-SHA256 against
   `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET`. If secret not set → warns and allows (graceful degradation).
   If set and signature invalid → 401 reject.
9. `src/app/api/whatsapp/route.js` — Same signature verification as Messenger.

### What's next
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** Add `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` to Vercel env vars (Settings → Environment
  Variables). Get it from Meta Developer Portal → App → App Secret. Once set, webhooks will
  enforce signature verification and reject any forged POST requests.
- Confirm Vercel build green after today's 9 commits.
- Ongoing: acquire custom domain (unlocks Resend + Google Calendar OAuth verification).

### Mistakes & lessons
- `supabase.from("clients").select("*")` in `requireClient()` was fetching the entire clients
  table on every authenticated API call — a performance and data-scope problem. Always add
  `.eq()` filter at DB level, not in JS.
- Hardcoded fallback values in source code (||"real-value") are a secret leak even when the
  "real" env var is set: the fallback is stored in git history forever. Never use real values
  as fallbacks.


## Last session (2026-07-30)

Long session. Two threads: **Meta App Review prep** and **fixing real bugs found while preparing it**.

### Bugs found and fixed

1. **Instagram was silently dead.** Webhooks arrived, nothing happened. Cause: we stored
   Instagram's *app-scoped* id (`me?fields=id`, e.g. 28445178038400379) but webhooks carry
   the *IG account* id (`me?fields=user_id`, e.g. 17841441686062791), so `getChannelByPage`
   missed on every message. Fixed in `api/ig/callback`; DB row corrected; duplicate stale
   IG channel deleted. IG DM + comment→inbox now confirmed working.
2. **IG send URL** used `/me/messages`; Instagram needs `/{ig_account_id}/messages`.
   `page_id` is now threaded through every send call in `messenger.js` / `bot.js`.
3. **FB private reply used a retired endpoint.** `/{comment-id}/private_replies` returns a
   generic `(#100) ... does not support this operation`. Moved to the Send API
   (`/{page-id}/messages` with `recipient.comment_id`), same shape as the IG path. Confirmed
   working — Facebook now shows "Page responded privately".
4. **Multi-tenant leak (serious).** `api/me` seeded every new client by copying a shared
   `app_settings` row with id `default` — which held Evalora jewellery's name, greeting and a
   4,800-char jewellery sales prompt. Every new signup inherited another business's brand.
   Now each tenant is seeded from its own `business_name`; the `default` row was made neutral.
5. **Onboarding threw away the client's work.** "Skip for now" was `setStep("choose"); return;`
   — the business description was discarded. Combined with Gemini being 429'd, *every* new
   client today would have ended up with a knowledge-free bot. Added `src/lib/profile.js`
   `composeProfile()` — deterministic, no AI. Generation now upgrades a profile; it never
   creates it. Skip saves via `mode:"raw"`. `getSystemPrompt` fallback no longer improvises.
6. **Page picker scrolled out of view.** Unbounded radio list in a short popup. Rebuilt with a
   bounded scroll area, search box and sticky Connect button.
7. **Comment fallback was hardcoded bilingual** ("ধন্যবাদ! ... / Thanks! ..."). When Gemini
   fails the fallback *is* the customer-facing reply, so it now follows the commenter's script.
8. **Post-connect redirect** went to `/#channels` (landing page) instead of `/dashboard#channels`
   for FB and IG. WA was already correct.
9. Added `/api/ig/deauth` (required by Meta App Review).
10. IG OAuth scope gained `instagram_business_manage_comments`.

### Design system

New token system applied across the whole app. Gold `#f0c040` → periwinkle `#5B8CFF` primary;
amber survives as warning only; mint `#2ED3A7` means exactly one thing (a bot is live).
Surfaces are blue-black, never pure black. Type: Geist + Geist Mono + Hind Siliguri for Bangla.
Signature element: a 2px state rail on the left edge of cards and rows.
Nine files carried their own copy of the old palette (landing, pricing, admin, legal pages) —
all migrated. **Still to do:** replace hex literals with `var(--…)` reads so there is one source
of truth. A standalone design-system reference page was produced for review.

---

## Next up — resume exactly here

**Blocked on one step, then Video 1 can be recorded.**

`pages_manage_engagement` is missing from the token, so public comment replies fail with
`(#200) Permissions error`. The Facebook Login *configuration* (id `2178064332957710`) — not a
`scope` param — decides permissions. `pages_manage_engagement` and `business_management` were
added to it, but the old token is still in use.

Do this in order:
1. `facebook.com/settings?tab=business_tools` → AutoLogic → **Remove**  ← the step that keeps
   getting skipped; without it Facebook never re-prompts and the old token persists.
2. Dashboard → Channels → Facebook → Disconnect.
3. Connect new channel → Facebook → **"Opt in to all current and future Pages"**.
4. Comment on the pricing post → dashboard should show "Replied", not a red error.
5. Then record **Video 1**.

### Meta App Review plan

Three videos, nine permissions. Same video link can back several permissions; each permission
still needs its own usage description. Put timestamps in the YouTube description and cite them
in the reviewer instructions.

- **Video 1 — Facebook** (~4 min): pages_manage_metadata · pages_read_engagement · pages_manage_engagement
- **Video 2 — Instagram** (~4 min): instagram_business_basic · ..._manage_messages · ..._manage_comments
- **Video 3 — WhatsApp** (~3 min): business_management · whatsapp_business_management · whatsapp_business_messaging

Already approved: `pages_show_list`, `pages_messaging`.

**Recording setup that works:** two Chrome profiles side by side, 55/45 — left is the dashboard
(owner account), right is Facebook/Instagram as a *second* account playing the customer. Text
overlay, no narration. OBS at 1920×1080/30fps, MP4, cursor capture on, extensions unpinned,
bookmarks hidden. Every test message and comment must be **in English** — the reviewer cannot
read Bangla, and the bot mirrors the customer's language.

**Two earlier takes were rejected in review:** the first ran only 2:15 and covered one
permission of three; both had the bot replying in Bangla. Do not cut Segments 3 and 4 — they
are the only evidence for two of the three permissions.

**Assets ready:** 3 Facebook posts, 3 Instagram posts (1080×1080, generated to match the new
design system), all carrying a "Comment DETAILS / PRICE / DEMO" call to action so comment
automation looks natural to a reviewer.

### Also pending

- **Booking pipeline** is instrumented but untested end to end. `gcal_connected` is true and a
  refresh token exists, but `gcal_token_expiry` was stale. Unverified Google apps get 7-day
  refresh tokens, so it may simply be dead — `getValidAccessToken` now detects `invalid_grant`,
  clears `gcal_connected` and logs it. Reconnect Calendar, book a meeting, read the
  `[booking]` log lines to see which step fails.
- **Google Cloud billing** — Gemini is 429ing. Comment replies are landing on the fallback
  rather than real AI output. Fix before recording if the videos should show the bot at its best.
- **Custom domain** — still blocks Resend email verification and Google Calendar OAuth
  verification.

## Start here every session

1. Read this file.
2. Read `lessons.md` — the running log of mistakes and the rule each produced. It exists so the
   same mistake is not repeated. Append to it whenever a new one is found.
3. Pick up from **Next up** above.

## How I work here

1. **Verify before asserting.** This session produced a wrong confident diagnosis (claimed the
   Page list was scrolled; it was actually Business-Portfolio ownership hiding the Page from
   `/me/accounts`). Check logs, DB or the Graph API first, then state the cause.
2. **Team / sub-agent mindset.** Break work into stages, verify each before moving on.
3. **Token discipline.** Reuse the clone, read only the lines needed, batch edits.
4. **This file.** Update "Last session" and "Next up" at the end of each session.
5. **Enterprise standard.** One-click, no token/ID hunting. And fix the *system*, not the
   symptom — the Evalora leak was one client's settings; the real bug was the seeding path.
6. **Quality over speed.** `node --check` before pushing; Vercel READY is the proof.

## Architecture

- **Prompt system (3 tiers, enforced in code):** `FIXED_BASE` + `FIXED_ECOM`/`FIXED_AGENCY`
  by business_type + the client's own profile from `app_settings`. Clients cannot remove the
  fixed rules. `getSystemPrompt` reads `businessPrompt || systemPrompt || safe fallback`.
- **Key files:** `src/lib/bot.js` (reply engine, booking, comments, typing),
  `src/lib/messenger.js` (send/parse, all channels), `src/lib/profile.js` (AI-free profile
  composer), `src/lib/oauth-state.js` (signed state, 30-min TTL), `src/lib/rate-limit.js`,
  `src/lib/route-errors.js`, `src/lib/gcal.js`, `src/lib/plans.js`.
- **Channels:** `/api/<fb|ig|wa>/login → callback → select`, signed state throughout.
  Calendar: `/api/gcal/login → callback`.
- **Onboarding:** `onboarding → connect → connect-cal (agency only) → app`.

## Known Meta constraints (not bugs)

- FB/IG cannot reply-to-a-specific-message or react via API. WhatsApp can.
- Private reply to a comment: once only, within 7 days, needs `pages_messaging`. A Page cannot
  private-reply to another Page or to its own admin — always test from a second personal profile.
- Pages owned by a Business Portfolio do **not** appear in `/me/accounts` without
  `business_management`. AutoLogic Systems had to be removed from the portfolio to be connectable.
- WhatsApp typing indicator also marks the message read.
